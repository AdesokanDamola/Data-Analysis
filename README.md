# Data-Driven Insights for Pizza Place Sales: EDA and Recommendations üçïüìà

# Introduction
In this project, I dived into a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions and boost revenue. 

# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Maven Analytics, a guided learning platform that offers curated datasets for practicing data enthusiasts.

# Tool Used
I leveraged the power of Microsoft Excel üõ†Ô∏èüìä to preprocess and merge the data from multiple CSV files, creating interactive visualizations using pivot tables and charts to gain deeper insights.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

1. Identify the number of customers and orders per month.
2. Determine if there is a peak hour for customers and orders.
3. Uncover the bestselling product and category.
4. Analyze sales trends over time.
5. Estimate the total income for the year.
6. Identify pizzas to take off the menu and pizzas to promote.

# Methodology
Data collection involved extracting sales data from five CSV files, including "order_details," "orders," "pizza_types," and "pizzas." Data preprocessing was minimal as the dataset was pre-cleaned using Power Query.

# Key Observations
1. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between the number of customers and the number of orders, with customers often ordering more than one product per visit.
2. The month of July emerged as the peak sales period, generating the highest revenue of the year.
3. The "CLASSIC" category stood out as the best-performing category, with a wide variety of size options compared to others.
4. There are usually more orders between 11am to 12pm.
5. XXL pizza size offered only by the classic category is the least ordered pizza.
6. There are five pizzas with no order for the year.

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, I have a few recommendations to enhance the pizza place's performance:

1. Promote the top 10 pizzas to maximize revenue and capitalize on customer preferences.
2. Introduce XL and XXL sizes for other categories, replicating the success of the "CLASSIC" category.
3. Streamline the menu by removing five pizzas with no sales to increase operational efficiency.
4. Improve customer service during the peak hours of 11 am to 12 pm by deploying additional staff to handle the influx of orders efficiently.
5. Incorporate geographical information to optimize the restaurant's location and explore potential expansion opportunities.
6. Utilize customer details to identify and reward loyal customers with deserving discounts.
